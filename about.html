    <h1>A little About me</h1>

    <h2>How I got into Photography</h2>
    <div>
      <p style="font-size:20px; width:700px; float:left">Growing up I always loved to take pictures. I always just took random pictures
        of landscape as my family and I drove across the country. But it wasn't until
        highschool when I really began to get into photography for real</p>

      <h2>My Style of photography</h2>
      <div>
        <p style="font-size:20px; width:700px; float:left">My style of photography is very unique. I love when the pictures I take of people
          tell a story. As well as allow you to see within this person's life and personality
          and know them better. It is always very fun getting to know each person and helping
          to document who they are within a few pictures</p>

      <h2>My Vision as a Photographer</h2>

      <div>
        <p style="font-size:20px; width:700px; float:left">My goal in doing these photoshoots isn't just to help portray people as who they truly are
          but to help them to realize who they are and to understand their worth</p>
